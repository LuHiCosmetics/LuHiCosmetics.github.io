I"Å<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/">C</a>¬†is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972.¬†It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.</p>

<p>Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Structured language
    <ul>
      <li>It has the ability to divide and hide all the information and instruction.</li>
      <li>Code can be partitioned in C using functions or code block.</li>
      <li>C is a well structured language compare to other.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>General purpose language
    <ul>
      <li>Make it ideal language for system programming.</li>
      <li>It can also be used for business and scientific application.</li>
      <li>ANSI established a standard for c in 1983.</li>
      <li>The ability of c is to manipulate bits,byte and addresses.</li>
      <li>It is adopted in later 1990.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Portability
    <ul>
      <li>Portability is the ability to port or use the software written .</li>
      <li>One computer C program can be reused.</li>
      <li>By modification or no modification.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Code Re-usability &amp; Ability to customize and extend
    <ul>
      <li>A programmer can easily create his own function</li>
      <li>It can can be used repeatedly in different application</li>
      <li>C program basically collection of function</li>
      <li>The function are supported by ‚Äòc‚Äô library</li>
      <li>Function can be added to ‚Äòc‚Äô library continuously</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Limited Number of Key Word
    <ul>
      <li>There are only 32 keywords in ‚ÄòC‚Äô</li>
      <li>27 keywords are given by ritchie</li>
      <li>5 is added by ANSI</li>
      <li>The strength of ‚ÄòC‚Äô is lies in its in-built function</li>
      <li>Unix system provides as large number of C function</li>
      <li>Some function are used in operation .</li>
      <li>Other are for specialized in their application
